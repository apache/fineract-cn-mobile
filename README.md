# Android Client of Apache Fineract CN

Android Client is built on top of the Apache Fineract CN platform. It is the mobile field agent application for its web counterpart

## Building the Project
1. Install [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
2. Download, install, and run the latest version of [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).
3. Fork our repo from `https://github.com/apache/fineract-cn-mobile`
4. From your terminal, download a copy of the forked repo with `git clone https://github.com/your_username/fineract-cn-mobile.git` where `your_username` is your GitHub username.
5. Enter the new **fineract-cn-mobile** directory with `cd fineract-cn-mobile`.
6. Set the upstream remote to the original repository url so that git knows where to fetch updates from in future: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/fineract-cn-mobile.git`
7. Import the project to Android Studio.
 - Launch the Android Studio application
 - Click on `File>Open...>{$FOLDER NAME}`
5. Once the gradle build is finished, add a virtual device
 - Click on the dropdown on the toolbar beside the green play button that has "No Devices" selected

 - Select the "AVD MANAGER" option
 - Click on the "Create Virtual Device" button
 - Select a hardware device and choose "Next"
 - Select a system image and choose "Next". You will need to download it first if it's your first time running android studio.

6. Launch the created AVD in the emulator
 - Click on the play button on the newly opened window (Android Virtual Device Manager) to launch the virtual device.

### Common Errors and Fixes
1. /dev/kvm permission denied
 - When choosing a system image, you may come accross this issue. You can find a solution to this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37300811/android-studio-dev-kvm-device-permission-denied)
2. System UI isn't responding
 - Some time after launching the virtual device, you might encounter this error. This can be solved by choosing a virtual device of lower resolution such as the Nexus 4
